in conf.c, replaced interrupt vectors with signals SIGUSR1/2
in iosetvec, configure to use a signal handler to call our dispatch routine, instead of using the device vectors
in ioint, instead of using PSW to find correct entry in intmap, we use hardcode console
in ttyiin/ttyoin, had to manually enable/disable the "interrupt" bit, since we don't have hardware to do it manually
in initialize.c, need to get some shared memory to simulate the control status register for our tty device
in initialize.c, had to remove the write call from the idle thread, because it could potentially block while waiting for a semaphore, and if it does then there's nothing on the ready queue, so XINU crashes when it tries to resched.
in tty.h, had to increase buffer size so that output wasn't jumbled between processes
in writcopy: added sluenable??
